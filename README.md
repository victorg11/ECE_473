ECE 473/573 - System Design with Microcontrollers

This repository contains all labs and in-class exercises for this course taken in Fall 2019 at Oregon State University. All these assignments are cummulative and build towards the final project (lab 6). The final product is an FM Radio Alarm Clock capable of local temperature sensing and automatic brightness adjustment for the 7-segment display.
