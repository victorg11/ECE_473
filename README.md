# ECE_473
ECE 473/573 - System Design with Microcontrollers

This repository contains all labs and in-class exercises for this course taken in Fall 2019 at Oregon State University. All these assignments are cummulative and build towards the final project (lab 6). The final product is an FM Radio Alarm Clock capable of local temperature sensing and automatic brightness adjustment for the 7-segment display. 

Project Capabilities:
- Local temperature sensor display on an LCD display (in Celcius and Fahrenheit).
- Displayed volume using a bar graph.
- Designed and assembled a bandpass amplifier using an op-amp.
- Implemented multipurpose encoders for alarm and time adjustment, as well as radio station adjustment.
- Mounted button board for alarm clock control and volume control.
- Incorporated 7-segment display automatic brightness adjustment feature using chip PWM; output was reliant on photoresistor readings, which were read using ADCs.
